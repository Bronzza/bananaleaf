Task:
Create a full responsive website for "Banana Leaf International Private Child Care" using pure HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
We are using Prepros for SCSS preprocessing, following the BEM methodology.

General requirements:

Mobile-first, fully responsive and adaptive for all screen sizes.
Primary colors:
Leaf Green (main tone)
Cream (accent tone)
Design Style: tropical jungle plants style, with optional bamboo or tropical plant decorative elements.
Use FontAwesome for icons.
Use sample/mock images where necessary.
Use system default fonts, or optionally suggest clean modern fonts like Poppins or Nunito (Google Fonts).

SCSS Setup:
Apply the provided nullify/reset CSS.
Use the provided adaptive-value mixin to ensure adaptive sizes.
Include a _variables.scss file if needed to manage reusable SCSS variables.
Set maximum width:
$maxWidthContainer: 1280
$maxWidth: 1920
No scroll animations needed, static transitions only.
Code must be clean, commented, and structured following BEM naming rules

Website Structure:
1. Sticky Header
Fixed at the top.
At page load: header is transparent (only shows navigation buttons with a thin bottom border).
On scroll (any scroll amount): header changes to solid background color (no longer transparent).
Navigation links inside (use basic anchor links for now).
Smooth scroll behavior to sections.

2. Hero Section (Landing Fullscreen):
Full-screen carousel/slider using Slick Slider.
Each slide shows a full-background image.
Overlaid content (centered or nicely placed):
Brand name: "Banana Leaf International Private Child Care"
"Call Us" button (simple tel: link, e.g., tel:+123456789).
"Apply Now" button (simple mailto: link to open default email client).

3. "Why Banana Leaf Child Care" Section
Three main asymmetric parts:
A main image (prominent)
A text description (main focus area)
A block with "our benefits" (smaller blocks on the side)
Behavior on hover:
When user hovers over any benefit block, update (change) the image and description dynamically according to the selected benefit.
Smooth but simple hover effects (static style, no scroll animations).

4. "Our Story" Section
Text block telling about the organization ("Who we are").
Underneath: a photo gallery slider built with Slick Slider.
Gallery images should be easily replaceable by the user (sample images initially).

5. Admission Section
Grid of clickable blocks/cards:
"Prices and Fees"
"Calendar"
On click, each opens a frontend-only popup (simple modal window).
Calendar shows holidays and working days (static view, no interactivity).

6. Footer
Contains:
Contact information (phone number, address, email).
Simple and clean layout.
Follow general website colors (green and cream).

Technical Notes:
For email: "Apply Now" opens default email client with mailto: link. No backend form submission needed.
For phone: "Call Us" uses tel: link.
Popups must be pure frontend modals â€” no server side needed.
Use basic slick slider options, no custom arrows needed unless you want to style them.
Basic browser compatibility (modern browsers, no need for IE11 support).
Include SCSS source files organized logically (ex: /scss/blocks, /scss/base, etc.)
